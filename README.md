# JavaScript - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.


### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Used [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided and customized for better appearance.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, appended table on a web page and filled up with eye-witness reports.

* Created event listener that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Index.html page for the Level2 project located at root directory

* After satisfying all requirements from Level1 assignment, I've added additional drop down filters:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
